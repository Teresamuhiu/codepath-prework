## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Make a list of your favorite 3-5 applications and identify 2-3 features that make them your favorite app. It's okay if features repeat on different apps
Tiktok- For you page(algorithm personalizes videos), endless scroll(addicting but effective format), built in sounds for content
Youtube- Adsense for creators, personalized videos through suggested videos, long video formats(compared to tiktok for example)
LinkedIn-Easy Apply for job apps, combination of posts and job search platform, premium features

 Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.
 I would like to improve a web app I am already building but learn how to do so on a mobile platform. It is an ecommerce app local artisans in Kenya. It is platform intended for them to be able to deliver their work to people that are not able to go to their shop in person.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
